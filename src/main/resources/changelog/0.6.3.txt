Changes:

* Bumped Minecraft requirement to 1.18.2.
* Added "passthrough" mode to "NetByteBuf", which is useful for using "CheckingNetByteBuf"s for regular minecraft packets.
* Added initial backend support for "NetworkDrainCleaner", a work-in-progress full network debugging tool based on LNS.
* Added "BlockEntityInitialData.getPlayersWatching( [BlockEntity] | [ServerWorld, BlockPos] )", which is used to workaround BlockEntity data getting sent too early.
* Changed InternalMsgUtil.wrapFullPayload to always check for packets that are too long even when "-ea" isn't specified as a JVM option.
* Changed debug types to use a "LARGE" packet size (3 bytes for length) rather than "NORMAL" (2 bytes) 

Bugfixes:

* Fixed InternalMsgUtil.onReceive not catching netty's "CodecException" as well.
* Fixed InternalMsgUtil.onReceive not allowing the usage of "ByteBuf.mark()" inside packet reading / writing
* Fixed NetIdBase.set[Tiny|Normal|Large]Size() methods not working.
* Improved CoreMinecraftNetUtils handling of null or invalid connections.
